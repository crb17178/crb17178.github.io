		<H4 style="font-family:helvetica;"> </H4> 
		<H4>For many people visiting Athens, Ga it can be overwhelming with all of the restaurants to choose from. Athens is filled with many diverse, trendy restaurants with great atmospheres and even greater food. For a typical day in Athens, Ga I would recommend three restaurants that every person passing through should try.

		<td> <B>MAMA's BOY</B>
		</td>
		<td>
		<p> Mama's Boy is a delicious southern-styled breakfast and lunch restaurant. It is a traditional go-to for many residents of Athens, so you have to get there early to beat the crowd. It is my favorite place to get breakfast, and it is a fun place to bring friends and family. My recommendation would wbe to get a strawberry lemonade and an Egg, Cheddar and Bacon biscuit. They also have Gluten free and vegan options, just ask your server!

		</td>
		<td>
			<p> Taqueria Del Sol is a local restaurant that serves Mexican-cuisine inspired food. Customers order at the counter and the food is brought to the table in a matter of seconds. The food is outstanding and the prices are very affordable. There is outdoor seating and heaters to keep you warm in the winter. My recommendation would be to get the Chips and jalapeno queso and the fried chicken tacos.

	</td>
	<td>
	This Southwestern inspired Southern Cuisine restaurant is conveniently located in Downtown Athens, Ga. It is a very popular restaurant for dinner, especially on game days. It is decorated with local artwork and is widely recognized by the huge mural on the side of the building. The food and service is very good, and the Last Resort Grill is a great place to bring friends and family to enjoy a meal. My recommendations would be to get the Salmon & Grits and, of course, the Oreo cheescake.
